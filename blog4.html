									<h2 style="text-align:left;"><a>LEADERSHIP ASSISTANT IN
										MASTERMIND SESSIONS</a></h2>
								</header>
								<p  style="text-align:left;">As a Leadership Assistant for Upstate Founders, my acute attention to detail and ability to identify problems allowed me to play a critical role in improving the "Meeting Health" of the masterminds during the course of the program.</p>
								<p  style="text-align:left;">
								My exceptional collaboration skills were put to the test as I met regularly with my Leadership Assistant group and bi-weekly with Program Leaders, where I was able to effectively communicate and work towards finding solutions for the top 2-3 use cases. These meetings allowed me to showcase my strong problem-solving skills and leadership abilities as I provided insightful recommendations to drive success for Upstate Founders.</p>
								<p  style="text-align:left;">
								I am proud to have been a part of this program and to have made a significant impact on its success. My experience as a Leadership Assistant has not only honed my skills but has also provided me with a valuable opportunity to network with entrepreneurs and gain a deeper understanding of the behind-the-scenes process of launching a business.</p>
